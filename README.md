Jomo Kenyatta Chatbot

This is a basic chatbot built with Python, NLTK, TF-IDF, and Streamlit that answers questions using text from a Jomo Kenyatta file.
The text is split into sentences.
User questions are compared to those sentences similarity.
The most similar sentence is returned as the answer.
jomochatbot.py contains the main code.
Jomo_Kenyatta.txt is the source text.
requirements.txt lists dependencies.
Accuracy is limited because the bot only matches sentences from the text.
