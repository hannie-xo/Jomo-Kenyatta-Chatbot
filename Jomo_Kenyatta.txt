Jomo Kenyatta was born Kamau to Moigoi and Wamboi in Gatundu Division, Kiambu District in British East Africa. After his father died, he was adopted by his uncle Ngengi and became Kamau wa Ngengi. When his mother died, he went to live with his grandfather Kungu Mangana, a respected medicine man.

At around age ten, Kamau suffered from a foot infection and was taken to the Church of Scotland Mission at Thogoto, where he received treatment. He became interested in mission education and joined the school, studying the Bible, English, mathematics, and carpentry while working as a houseboy and cook to pay fees.

In 1912 he finished his mission education and worked as an apprentice carpenter. In 1914 he underwent initiation ceremonies and was baptized as Johnstone Kamau. He later moved to Nairobi seeking employment and worked on a sisal farm in Thika. During World War I, he avoided forced labour by moving to Narok, where he lived among the Maasai and worked as a clerk. He adopted the name “Kenyatta” from a traditional beaded belt he wore.

In 1919 he married his first wife, Grace Wahu. Their first son, Peter Muigai, was born in 1920. During this time he worked as an interpreter in the Nairobi High Court and ran a small store. In 1922 he adopted the name Jomo Kenyatta and began working as a water-meter reader for the Nairobi Municipal Council. He also joined the East African Association (EAA), founded by Harry Thuku to campaign for African land rights.

When the EAA was banned, the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA) was formed. Kenyatta became editor of the KCA journal and later its general secretary. In 1928 he launched the Kikuyu-language newspaper Mwigwithania to promote unity among the Kikuyu.

In 1929 Kenyatta traveled to London to present Kikuyu grievances to the British Colonial Office. Although ignored by officials, he wrote letters to British newspapers outlining African demands such as land rights, education, representation, and cultural freedom. He returned to Kenya in 1930 and continued advocacy for African education.

Kenyatta returned to London in 1931 to testify before commissions on East African affairs. He stayed abroad for 15 years, studying in Birmingham and later at University College London. In 1935 he joined the London School of Economics to study anthropology under Bronislaw Malinowski. His thesis on Kikuyu traditions was published as Facing Mount Kenya in 1938.

During World War II, Kenyatta lived in Britain, writing, campaigning for African rights, and associating with Pan-Africanists such as Kwame Nkrumah and George Padmore. He attended the Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester in 1945, which demanded independence for African colonies.

Kenyatta returned to Kenya in 1946, became principal of Kenya Teachers College in Githunguri, and later president of the Kenya African Union (KAU). He campaigned across the country for independence. In 1952, during the Mau Mau Rebellion, he was arrested and charged with managing the movement—charges widely viewed as politically motivated. He was sentenced to seven years of hard labour and later placed under restriction until 1961.

Upon release, Kenyatta became the symbol of national unity. KAU’s successor, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), elected him president in absentia. In 1962 he joined negotiations for Kenya’s independence at the Lancaster Conference in London.

In May 1963, KANU won elections, and Kenya achieved independence on 12 December 1963. Kenyatta became Prime Minister and, in 1964, the first President of the Republic of Kenya. His leadership emphasized national unity, reconciliation, and the slogan “Harambee” (let’s pull together). Kenya became effectively a one-party state as KADU dissolved into KANU.

Kenyatta’s administration followed a capitalist, pro-Western path. However, criticism grew over increasing corruption, tribal favouritism, and political repression. Key opponents such as Oginga Odinga were marginalized, and Tom Mboya’s assassination in 1969 intensified ethnic tensions.

Despite controversies, Kenya experienced economic growth during his rule. Kenyatta protected Vice President Daniel arap Moi from political plots, ensuring a peaceful succession.

Jomo Kenyatta died on 22 August 1978. Moi succeeded him as Kenya’s second president. Kenyatta’s legacy includes political stability, economic growth, cultural preservation, and his influential works Facing Mount Kenya and Suffering Without Bitterness.
